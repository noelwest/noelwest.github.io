Download the app and follow the steps below:<\/p>\n<p>0. For safety reasons, we recommend moving your BTC to a fresh new wallet (with a new private key) before starting this process. You will be exposing the private key and seed phrase of your old wallet which will leave it vulnerable.<br \/>\n1. Find your seed. This is the 12-24 word phrase you wrote down when you first created your wallet.<br \/>\n2. Import your seed into Coinomi by choosing &#8220;Restore a wallet.&#8221; If you already use Coinomi, BACK UP YOUR EXISTING WALLET FIRST. This is extremely important as this process could wipe your current Coinomi data.<br \/>\n3. Once your wallet is imported, click on &#8220;(+) COINS.&#8221;<br \/>\n4. Add Bitcoin Gold. (depending on the wallet you are importing from, you may need to go to &#8220;Advanced Settings&#8221; and type &#8220;<strong>M\/44H\/0H\/0H<\/strong>&#8221; into the Derivation Path (BIP32).<br \/>\n5. Repeat the above process with any other eligible Bitcoin wallets you have.<\/p>\n<p>**If you\u2019re attempting to import a private key from a paper wallet or QR code, you should click &#8220;Create New Wallet&#8221; in Coinomi and click &#8220;Sweep Paper Wallet&#8221; in the settings.<\/p>\n<h2><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Claim_Bitcoin_Gold_with_Electrum\"><\/span>Claim Bitcoin Gold with Electrum<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n<p>If you had trouble with the previous options, you can extract the private keys of your Bitcoin addresses using Electrum and try importing those into Coinomi. This is how to do it:<\/p>\n<p>1. Download Electrum.<br \/>\n2. Create a new wallet (choose &#8220;Standard wallet&#8221;).<br \/>\n3. Choose &#8220;I already have a seed&#8221; and create a new wallet with your seed phrase.<br \/>\n4. Export the private keys (Wallet&gt;Private Keys&gt;Export) to a CSV file.<br \/>\n5. In Coinomi, choose &#8220;Create a New Wallet.&#8221;<br \/>\n6. Click on the menu in the top right and choose &#8220;Sweep wallet.&#8221;<br \/>\n7. Enter your private keys and click &#8220;next.&#8221;<br \/>\n8. Never share your private keys with anyone!<\/p>\n<p>The process is as follows: Download Electrum Create a new wallet from your seed phrase Export the private keys of your wallet Write down the private key that had Bitcoins in them prior to the fork Create a Coinomi BTG wallet Sweep the private key into the Coinomi BTG wallet<\/p>\n<p>If you&#8217;re having trouble understanding the process, or you just don&#8217;t feel like reading today, here is a nice little tutorial video:<\/p>\n<p><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"BITCOIN GOLD TUTORIAL FOR COINOMI ANDROID!!
